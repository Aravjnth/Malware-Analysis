# Malware Analysis

## Overview

The Malware Analysis project is a Python-based toolkit designed for analyzing and understanding malicious software (malware). This toolkit provides utilities and scripts to analyze malware samples, extract indicators of compromise (IOCs), and perform behavioral analysis to identify malicious behaviors and capabilities.

## Features

- Analyze malware samples (executables, scripts, documents).
- Extract metadata, strings, and embedded artifacts from malware.
- Perform static analysis to identify malicious patterns and signatures.
- Execute malware in isolated environments for dynamic analysis.
- Generate reports and visualizations on malware behaviors and characteristics.
- User-friendly command-line interface for ease of use.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pefile` library for PE (Portable Executable) file analysis (Windows binaries)
- `pyelftools` library for ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file analysis (Linux binaries)
- `oletools` library for analyzing Microsoft Office documents (optional)
- `volatility` framework for memory forensics (optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/Aravjnth/Malware-Analysis.git
    cd malware-analysis
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Analyze a malware sample statically:
    ```bash
    python analyze_static.py --file <malware-sample>
    ```

2. Execute malware in a controlled environment for dynamic analysis:
    ```bash
    python analyze_dynamic.py --file <malware-sample>
    ```

3. Explore additional analysis techniques and tools provided in the toolkit.

### Example

Analyze a malware sample statically:
```bash
python analyze_static.py --file malware.exe
```

Execute malware in a controlled environment:
```bash
python analyze_dynamic.py --file malware.exe
```

## Options

- `--file`: Path to the malware sample for analysis.
